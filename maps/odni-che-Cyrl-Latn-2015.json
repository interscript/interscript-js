It is not intended to\neliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide an\nIC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Chechen that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example: Ilyas\nAkhmadkant (also seen as Ilyas Axmadkhant, Ильяс Ахмадкӏант). This convention is designed\nto ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Chechen-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will\noccur without the use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system\nwill be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing\nconventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.\n","notes":["Add a preceding 'y' if the vowel is preceded by the sound of a 'y' consonant.","This is a single apostrophe as found on regular US keyboards (ASCII character 39),\nthough software may render the apostrophe with differing appearances (e.g. curved left or right).\nNote that the same apostrophe is used for 'ъ', '|', 'ӏ', and '1'.\n","A word-initial hard sign 'ъ' is not represented, but instead is left out of the transliteration.","The romanization follows the dialect spoken in Chechnya rather than other local pronunciations.","Long and short vowels are not distinguished in this system.","In the Roman, no distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh' and single contiguous letters (e.g. 's' followed by 'h').","The Cyrillic soft sign ('ь') by itself (not part of a digraph) is not represented, but instead is left out of the transliteration.","Interpretation of Cyrillic digraphs in Table 1 takes precedence over interpretation of the individual characters. Thus, 'кх' -> 'q', and not to 'k' followed by 'kh'.","Transliteration of Cyrillic digraphs for diphthongs will follow the combination of the transliteration of the individual characters. Thus, 'aй' -> 'ay', 'oй' -> 'oy', and both 'эй' and 'eй' -> 'ey'."],"tests":[{"source":"Ильяс Ахмадкӏант","expected":"Ilyas Akhmadkant"},{"source":"Ильяс Ахмадк1ант","expected":"Ilyas Akhmadkant"}],"map":{"rules":[{"pattern":"(?<!\\b\\u2019)\\b\\u0415","result":"Ye"},{"pattern":"(?<!\\b\\u2019)\\b\\u0435","result":"ye"},{"pattern":"(\\W+)1(\\W+)","result":"\\1ӏ\\2"},{"pattern":"(\\W+)1","result":"\\1ӏ"},{"pattern":"1(\\W+)","result":"ӏ\\1"}],"characters":{"\\u0410":"A","\\u0411":"B","\\u0412":"V","\\u0413":"G","\\u0413\\u04C0":"Gh","\\u0414":"D","\\u0415":"E","\\u0416":"J","\\u0417":"Z","\\u0418":"I","\\u0418\\u042B":"I","\\u042B":"Е","\\u041A":"K","\\u041A\\u04C0":"K","\\u041A\\u0445":"Q","\\u041A\\u044A":"Q","\\u041B":"L","\\u041C":"M","\\u041D":"N","\\u041E":"O","\\u041F":"P","\\u041F\\u04C0":"Ph","\\u0420":"R","\\u0421":"S","\\u0422":"T","\\u0422\\u04C0":"T","\\u0423":"U","\\u0424":"F","\\u0425":"Kh","\\u0425\\u044C":"H","\\u0425\\u04C0":"H","\\u04B8":"Ts","\\u04B8\\u04C0":"Ts","\\u0427":"Ch","\\u0427\\u04C0":"Ch","\\u0428":"Sh","\\u042A":"'","\\u042D":"E","\\u042E":"Yu","\\u042F":"Ya","\\u04C0":"'","\\u042C":"","\\u0430":"a","\\u0431":"b","\\u0432":"v","\\u0433":"g","\\u0433\\u04CF":"gh","\\u0434":"d","\\u0435":"e","\\u0436":"j","\\u0437":"z","\\u0438":"i","\\u0438\\u0439":"i","\\u0439":"y","\\u043A":"k","\\u043A\\u04CF":"k","\\u043A\\u0445":"q","\\u043A\\u044A":"q","\\u043B":"l","\\u043C":"m","\\u043D":"n","\\u043E":"o","\\u043F":"p","\\u0440":"r","\\u0441":"s","\\u0442":"t","\\u0442\\u04CF":"t","\\u0443":"u","\\u0444":"f","\\u0445":"kh","\\u0445\\u044C":"h","\\u0445\\u04CF":"h","\\u04B9":"ts","\\u04B9\\u04CF":"ts","\\u0447":"ch","\\u0447\\u04CF":"ch","\\u0448":"sh","\\u044A":"'","\\u044B":"e","\\u044D":"e","\\u044E":"yu","\\u044F":"ya","\\u04CF":"'","\\u044C":""}}}}
