N.\nSharma. The tables and their corrections were published in volume II of\nthe conference reports1,2.\n\nThere is no evidence of the use of the system either in Bangladesh,\nin India or in international cartographic products. The resolution\nIV/17 (1982) recommended association, inter alia, with Bangladesh, in\ncarrying out further studies on the system.\n\nBengali (Bānglā) uses an alphasyllabic script whereby each character\nrepresents a syllable rather than one sound. Vowels and diphthongs are\nmarked in two ways: as independent characters (used syllable-initially)\nand in an abbreviated form, to denote vowels after consonants. The\nromanization table is unambiguous but the user would have to recognize\nmany ligatures not given in the original table. The system is mostly\nreversible but there exist some ambiguities in the romanization of\nvowels (independent vs. abbreviated characters) and consonants\n(ligatures vs. character sequences).\n\nOther systems of romanization\n\nFor differences between the UN system and the ISO transliteration\nstandard ISO 15919: 2001 see the section on the romanization of Hindi.\n\nReferences\n\nSecond United Nations Conference on the Standardization of\nGeographical Names.
