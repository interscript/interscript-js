When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n- Pure consonant ( cillŭ form) in Malayalam script, other than r/ṟ (ർ), before a consonant, as in n:na formed with a\n  pure consonant (not the ligature nna). Medial ൕ in Malayalam text shall be treated as a pure consonant ( cillŭ\n  form).\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","When the half-nasal in Telugu script is used for modern nasalization in writing Hindi or any other language, it shall be transliterated as a tilde above the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the tilde shall be attached to the second vowel","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question.","In Malayalam text, ് acts as the mātrā for ŭ when final in a word, except when it removes the inherent vowel of a single consonant.","The ambiguous pure consonant r/ṟ (ർ) in Malayalam script shall be transliterated into r when combined with another consonant; when it is final in a word it shall be transliterated as ṟ in Malayalam language."],"tests":[{"source":"സ്വപ്നയ്ക്കൊപ്പം ഹോട്ടലിൽ മന്ത്രിപുത്രൻ, ചിത്രങ്ങൾ; ൪ കോടി കമ്മിഷനിലും പങ്കുപറ്റി","expected":"svapnaykkaeāppam haōṭṭalai:la mantraipautra:ṇa, caitraṅṅa:ḷa; 4 kaōṭai kammaiṣanailaum paṅkaupaṟṟai"},{"source":"വിവാദങ്ങളിൽ മാപ്പില്ല, ആദ്യമായി ഐപിഎൽ കമന്ററിക്കില്ലാതെ മ‍ഞ്ജരേക്കര്‍; പുറത്ത് തന്നെ","expected":"vaivaādaṅṅaḷai:la maāppailla, ādyamaāyai aipaie:la kamanṟaṟaikkaillaātae mañjaraēkkaraŭ; pauṟattaŭ tannae"},{"source":"പരമാവധി ഊറ്റിയെടുത്തു; എല്ലാം കഴിഞ്ഞ് ഉപേക്ഷിച്ചു: വിങ്ങലോടെ റംസിയുടെ സഹോദരി","expected":"paramaāvadhai ūṟṟaiyaeṭauttau; ellaām kaḻaiññaŭ upaēkṣaiccau: vaiṅṅalaōṭae ṟaṁsaiyauṭae sahaōdarai"},{"source":"വഴിനീളെ രോഷം; യൂത്ത്‌ കോണ്‍ഗ്രസുകാരന്റെ  കയ്യൊടിഞ്ഞു, കൈവീശികാട്ടി ജലീൽ","expected":"vaḻainaīḷae raōṣam; yaūttaŭ kaōṇaŭgrasaukaāranṟae  kayyaoṭaiññau, kaaivaīśaikaāṭṭai jalaī:la"},{"source":"‘വികൃതിപ്പയ്യനാ’യിരുന്ന കോലി മിന്നും താരമായത് ഇന്ത്യൻ ക്രിക്കറ്റിന്റെ ഗുണം: അക്തർ","expected":"‘vaikaṛtaippayyanaā’yairaunna kaōlai mainnaum taāramaāyataŭ intya:ṇa kraikkaṟṟainṟae gauṇam: aktaṟ"},{"source":"ലോകത്തിനു വാക്സീൻ വേണമെങ്കിൽ ഈ നഗരം കനിയണം; തലയുയർത്തി ഇന്ത്യ","expected":"laōkattainau vaāksaī:ṇa vaēṇamaeṅkai:la ī nagaram kanaiyaṇam; talayauyarttai intya"},{"source":"‘അദ്ദേഹം ഒരു മകളെപ്പോലെ എന്നെ കേട്ടു’: ഗവർണറെ കണ്ട് കങ്കണ റനൗട്ട്","expected":"‘addaēham orau makaḷaeppaōlae ennae kaēṭṭau’: gavarṇaṟae kaṇṭaŭ kaṅkaṇa ṟanaṭṭaŭ"},{"source":"‘എല്ലാം ഫെയ്‌സ്ബുക്കില്‍ പറയുമെന്നു ജലീല്‍; കനത്ത സുരക്ഷയില്‍ യാത്ര, കരിങ്കൊടി","expected":"‘ellaām phaeyaŭsbaukkailaŭ paṟayaumaennau jalaīlaŭ; kanatta saurakṣayailaŭ yaātra, karaiṅkaoṭai"},{"source":"ഏറ്റവും ചെറുപ്പം ജോയി; ജയലക്ഷ്മി, ദീപ്തി, ജ്യോതി; പട്ടികയിലെ നിര ഇങ്ങനെ‌","expected":"ēṟṟavaum caeṟauppam jaōyai; jayalakṣmai, daīptai, jyaōtai; paṭṭaikayailae naira iṅṅanae"},{"source":"പരിശോധന കുറച്ച് കേരളം; കോവിഡ് ടെസ്റ്റ് പോസിറ്റിവിറ്റി നിരക്ക് എറ്റവും ഉയർന്ന്; ആശങ്ക‌","expected":"paraiśaōdhana kauṟaccaŭ kaēraḷam; kaōvaid̂aŭ ṭaesṟṟaŭ paōsaiṟṟaivaiṟṟai nairakkaŭ eṟṟavaum uyarnnaŭ; āśaṅka"},{"source":"൱","expected":"100"}],"map":{"rules":[{"pattern":"(?<=)\\u0D4D(?=\\b)","result":"ŭ"},{"pattern":"(?<=)\\u0D02(?=\\b)","result":"m"},{"pattern":"(?<=)\\u0D7C(?=\\b)","result":"ṟ"}],"characters":{"അ":"a","ആ":"ā","ഇ":"i","ഈ":"ī","ഉ":"u","ഊ":"ū","ഋ":"ṛ","ൠ":"ṝ","ഌ":"ḷ","ൡ":"ḹ","എ":"e","ഏ":"ē","ഐ":"ai","ഒ":"o","ഓ":"ō","ഔ":"au","ക":"ka","ഖ":"kha","ഗ":"ga","ഘ":"gha","ങ":"ṅa","ച":"ca","ഛ":"cha","ജ":"ja","ഝ":"jha","ഞ":"ña","ട":"ṭa","ഠ":"ṭha","ഡ":"d̂a","ഢ":"ḍha","ണ":"ṇa","ത":"ta","ഥ":"tha","ദ":"da","ധ":"dha","ന":"na","പ":"pa","ഫ":"pha","ബ":"ba","ഭ":"bha","മ":"ma","യ":"ya","ര":"ra","ർ":"r","റ":"ṟa","ല":"la","ള":"ḷa","ഴ":"ḻa","വ":"va","ശ":"śa","ഷ":"ṣa","സ":"sa","ഩ":"ṉa","ഹ":"ha","ഃ":"ḥ","ം":"ṁ","ഽ":":’","ാ":"ā","ി":"i","ീ":"ī","ു":"u","ൂ":"ū","്":"ŭ","ൃ":"ṛ","ൄ":"ṝ","\\u0D62":"ḷ","\\u0D63":"ḹ","െ":"e","േ":"ē","ൈ":"ai","ൊ":"o","ോ":"ō","ൌ":"au","्":"","़":"","ൗ":"","‍":"","‌":"","ക്":"k","ഖ്":"kh","ഗ്":"g","ഘ്":"gh","ങ്":"ṅ","ച്":"c","ഛ്":"ch","ജ്":"j","ഝ്":"jh","ഞ്":"ñ","ട്":"ṭ","ഠ്":"ṭh","ഡ്":"d̂","ഢ്":"ḍh","ണ്":"ṇ","ത്":"t","ഥ്":"th","ദ്":"d","ധ്":"dh","ന്":"n","പ്":"p","ഫ്":"ph","ബ്":"b","ഭ്":"bh","മ്":"m","യ്":"y","ര്":"r","റ്":"ṟ","ല്":"l","ള്":"ḷ","ഴ്":"ḻ","വ്":"v","ശ്":"ś","ഷ്":"ṣ","സ്":"s","ഩ്":"ṉ","ഹ്":"h","൦":"0","൧":"1","൨":"2","൩":"3","൪":"4","൫":"5","൬":"6","൭":"7","൮":"8","൯":"9","൰":"10","൱":"100","൲":"1000","ൺ":":na","ൻ":":ṇa","ൽ":":la","ൾ":":ḷa","ൿ":":ka"}}}}
