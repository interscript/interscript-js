It Is\nused for the romanization of standard geographic names in\nIran.\nThe Persian alphabet is the same as the Arabic alphabet\nexcept for the addition of four consonant symbols for\nsounds which do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the same\nconversion values are used for the Persian alphabet as for\nthe Arabic alphabet wherever phonetically valid. Where\nletters common to the two alphabets have different\npronunciation in the two languages, conversion values\nreflecting the Persian pronunciation are provided in the\nPersian system.\nIt may be noted that neither the system of pointing nor the\nconversion values for vowels and diphthongs are the same\nfor Persian as for Arabic.\nPersian presents the same problems of vowel pointing as\nArabic in that the short vowel symbols necessary for the\nproper rendering of short vowels, long vowels, and\ndiphthongs are almost always omitted from written Persian.\nIt follows that, in order to produce transliter- tions in\nterms of standard written Persian, the transliterator must\nbe able to identify the words used in names and must know\ntheir standard written Persian spelling, their proper vowel\npointing, and how to eliminate pecularities due to\ndialectical variation.\nThe notes and special rules explain details of\ntransliteration not stated in the tables.\n","notes":["1)The Persian writing system, in its generally used form,\nemploys only the symbols found in Table I, and the alef maddeh\n(آ) of Table II. The symbols in column 1 of Table II are\ntraditional auxiliary symbols used by Persians only\nsporadically to indicate the exact reading of a given word.\nIn the case of i, ū, ey and ow, a choice of symbology\nexists, one system adhering to the Arabic tradition, the\nother being a modification of it. Likewise, there are two\nways of writing alef maq§ureh. The BGN/PCGN transliteration\nsystem presupposes forms fully pointed with the Persian\nsymbols represented in Table II, though these are omitted\nfrom the examples given below.\n","2) Alef ( أ ) occurs with the following uses a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or diphthong, and the alef itself is not transliterated, e.g., انجيرة Anjīreh, ايواني Eyvānī b. Initially with maddeh ( آ ),it indicates ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān. c. Medially and finally. it represents ā, e.g., e.g., آبادان Ābādān, توكا Tūkā. d.\tWith hamzeh. See Note 5.","3) Where special considerations are paramount, the sub-dot may be used in place of the cedilla","4) The two-letter symbols kh, zh, sh, and gh are convenient for use and easily comprehensible. The infrequent sequences of kāf, ze, sīn, and gāf followed by he can be unequivocally transliterated for bibliographical purposes by the use of a slant line (“shilling,” “solidus\") to separate true h from a preceding k, z, s, or\tg; that is,\tkh represents khe, but k/h stands for kāf followed by he.","5) Hamzeh (ء)\tis\tnot regarded as a letter of the Persian alphabet, but as a diacritic mark, and as such is not always expressed in actual writing. In fully pointed words, however, it appears in several graphic forms, standing alone or written in conjunction with alef, vav, or ye (the ye in this instance being undotted). All these forms are transliterated simply with the apostrophe in the form resembling a small raised figure 9 (’)\t,e.g., جزء Joz’ صفراء şafrā’, مأخذ ma’khaz̄, مؤتمن mu’taman, پائين pā’īn Occasionally a word may appear pointed according to the strict Arabic tradition so as to indicate an initial hamzeh. This initial hamzeh is never transliterated, but only the vowel which it carries, e.g., •Jfi , whether pointed\tor\t0\t.\tis \"transliterated simply Anjireh.\t' Hamzeh is also sometimes written over final he or ye to represent the -ye form of the eg&feh, cf. Note 8.","6) Alef maddeh is used initially to indicate ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān Noninitially it indicates ’ā in words of Arabic origin, and must be so transliterated, e.g., قرآن Qor’ān, مآب ma’āb","7) Tashdid ( ّ) indicates doubling of the consonant over which it is written and is represented in transliteration by writing the consonant twice, e.g محمّد Mohammad The sequence kasreh ye ye is transliterated īy.In names of Arabic origin containing the definite article, the vowel of the article is transliterated according to its Persian pronunciation and the lam, when followed by a “sun letter” (t, s̄, d, z̄, r, s, sh, ẕ, ţ, z̧, ţ, z̧, l, n) is assimilated. The article is written in lower case and separate from the preceding and following word, e.g., Zeyn od Din, but *£4 . Zeyn ed Dīn. Cf. Special Rule 1.","8) The relational (ezafeh) suffix\tis\ttransliterated -e after final consonants (except for silent h). After silent h and after vowels, it is transliterated -ye. It is usually not expressed in Persian writing after a consonant (kasreh being understood), e.g., كوهِ مَرغٌوب Kuh-e Marghūb. After final alef or vav it is written with ye (ي), e.g., بايِ آب\tPa-ye Ab,\tجويِ آس Jū-ye Ās.\tAfter\tye (ي) and silent he it is written as hamzeh over the letter, e.g., دَهَانهٴ مَمبَر Dahāneh-ye Mambar, سَلَيٴ بُذٌرگ Salasi-ye Bozorrg.","1.\tIn Persian names of Arabic origin, the word division used for transliterating Arabic will obtain, except that names ending in the word Allah will be written solid and the a of Allah will be replaced by o, e.g.,\tThe Arabic definite article when not subject to assimilation will be written al in name-initial position but usually, ol elsewhere, e.g., Al JJal but 2u ol Faqar. Cf. Note 7 above.","2. In Persian names in general, in sequences of name elements pronounced as a single unit, division into separate words will be made after Persian letters written in the word final form. (But see the Rule immediately below.)","3. The word abad which occurs very frequently at the end of place names will be written solid with the preceding word; e.g., Allahabad, not Allah Abad.","4. Persian derivational endings such as vand and Turkish and other endings such as lar, li and lu will be written solid with the preceding word, whether so written in Persian script or not.","5. The letter he, when used in Turkish fashion for word internal e, will be transliterated eh as usual but will be written solid with the remainder of the word.","6. Kheplus vdv followed by long vowel or khe plus vdv followed by gammeh will be rendered khv although the v is not pronounced."],"tests":[{"source":"اَنجِيرة","expected":"Anjīreh"},{"source":"اِيْوَانِي","expected":"Eyvānī"},{"source":"آبادان","expected":"Ābādān"},{"source":"تُوكا","expected":"Tūkā"},{"source":"آبادان","expected":"Ābādān"},{"source":"قُرآن","expected":"Qor’ān"},{"source":"مَآب","expected":"Ma’āb"},{"source":"مُحَمَّد","expected":"Moḩammad"},{"source":"كُوهِ مَرغُوب","expected":"Kūh-e Marghūb"},{"source":"پَايِ آب","expected":"Pā-ye Āb"},{"source":"جُويِ آس","expected":"Jū-ye Ās"},{"source":"دَهَانِهٴ مَمبَر","expected":"Dahāneh-ye Mambar"},{"source":"سَلَسِيٴ بُذُرگ","expected":"Salasī-ye Boz̄org"},{"source":"عَبداللَّه","expected":"‘Abdollāh"},{"source":"ذُو الفَقَار","expected":"Z̄ū ol Faqār"},{"source":"اللَّه آبَاد","expected":"Allāhābād"},{"source":"اِيران","expected":"Īrān"}],"map":{"postrules":[{"pattern":"(?<=\\b)(?<!\\b[‘|’|'|-])[\\u0061-\\uFFFF]","result":"upcase"},{"pattern":" Ol","result":" ol"}],"characters":{"\\s\\u0622\\u0628\\u064E\\u0627\\u062F":"ābād","\\u064e(?=\\u0629)":"","\\u064e(?=a[h|t])":"","\\u064e":"a","\\u0650":"e","\\u064f":"o","\\u064e\\u0627":"ā","\\u0649\\u0670":"á","\\u0622":"’ā","\\b\\u0622":"ā","\\u0650[\\u064a|\\u06cc]":"ī","\\u064f\\u0648":"ū","\\u064e[\\u064a|\\u06cc]\\u0652":"ey","\\u0650[\\u064a|\\u06cc]\\u0652":"ey","\\u064e\\u0648":"ow","\\u0652":"","\\u0650\\u064a\\u0651":"īy","[\\u0654|\\u0674]":"-e","(?<=[\\u064a|\\u0647])[\\u0654|\\u0674]":"-ye","\\u0650\\b":"-e","[\\u064a|\\u06cc]\\u0650\\b":"-ye","\\u0628\\u0651":"bb","\\u062a\\u0651":"tt","\\u062b\\u0651":"s̄s̄","\\u062c\\u0651":"jj","\\u062d\\u0651":"ḩḩ","\\u062e\\u0651":"kh","\\u062f\\u0651":"dd","\\u0630\\u0651":"z̄z̄","\\u0631\\u0651":"rr","\\u0632\\u0651":"zz","\\u0633\\u0651":"ss","\\u0634\\u0651":"sh","\\u0635\\u0651":"şş","\\u0636\\u0651":"ẕẕ","\\u0637\\u0651":"ţţ","\\u0638\\u0651":"z̧z̧","\\u063a\\u0651":"gh","\\u0641\\u0651":"ff","\\u0642\\u0651":"qq","\\u0643\\u0651":"kk","\\u0644\\u0651":"ll","\\u0645\\u0651":"mm","\\u0646\\u0651":"nn","\\u0647\\u0651":"hh","\\u0648\\u0651":"vv","\\u064a\\u0651":"yy","\\u0659":"ê","\\u0629":"eh","\\b\\u0627\\u0644":"al ","\\s\\b\\u0627\\u0644":" ol ","\\ufdf2":"Allāh","\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u0651\\u064e\\u0647":"Allāh","(?<!\\b)\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u0651\\u064e\\u0647":"ollāh","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062a":"at t","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062b":"as̄ s̄","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062f":"ad d","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0630":"az̄ z̄","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0631":"ar r","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0632":"az z","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0633":"as s","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0634":"ash sh","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0635":"aş ş","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0636":"aẕ ẕ","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0637":"aţ ţ","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0638":"az̧ z̧","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644":"al l","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0646":"an n","\\u0621":"’","\\u0626":"’","\\u0623":"","\\u0625":"","\\u0627":"ā","\\b\\u0627":"","\\u0628":"b","\\u067E":"p","\\u062a":"t","\\u062B":"s̄","\\u062c":"j","\\u0686":"ch","\\u062d":"ḩ","\\u062e":"kh","\\u062f":"d","\\u0630":"z̄","\\u0631":"r","\\u0632":"z","\\u0698":"zh","\\u0633":"s","\\u0634":"sh","\\u0635":"ş","\\u0636":"ẕ","\\u0637":"ţ","\\u0638":"z̧","\\u0639":"‘","\\u063a":"gh","\\u0641":"f","\\u0642":"q","\\u0643":"k","\\u06A9":"k","\\u06AF":"g","\\u0644":"l","\\u0645":"m","\\u0646":"n","\\u0647":"h","\\u0648":"v","\\u064a":"y","\\u0649":"y","\\u06D0":"ē","\\u06CD":"êy"}}}}
