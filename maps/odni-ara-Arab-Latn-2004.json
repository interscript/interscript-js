Exceptions ’ayn and consonants represented by digraphs are not doubled (e.g., al-Qadhafi [not alQadhdhafi], Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).","Hamzah (glottal stop) The hamzah is represented by an apostrophe (’). Note that this is the same symbol used to represent another consonant, the ’ayn.","Ta’ marbutah (feminine ending marker) On the construct form or when pronounced “t”, it is represented with a roman t. In all other cases, it is represented with an h.","Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).","Definite article “al” (‘the’) Follows Arabic spelling rather than pronunciation. That is, sun letter assimilation is not shown in the Romanized form (e.g., ’Abd-alRahman, not ’Abd-ar-Rahman).","Diphthongs the second element of the diphthong is represented by a y or a w (rather than an i or a u) Haytham, Faysal, Tawfiq, Rawdah.","Hyphens Hyphens (-) are used to connect name elements within a name ’Abd- al Rahman, Abu-al-Bashar, Bin-Ladin. Exceptions Names that incorporate “Allah” as part of the name (e.g., ’Abdallah, Nasrallah), names marked by the lineage/family marker “Al” (e.g., Al Thani) are not hyphenated.","The definite article, “al”, within name phrases, is Romanized as al and not as ul Nur-al-Din (not Nur-ul-Din). It is not capitalized when name-initial.","Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name retain the a of Allah rather than a grammatical marker u ’Abdallah ( not ’Abdullah).","Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Arabic are spelled according to the standard Western tradition Georges, Michel. However, names of non-Arabic origin no longer considered foreign by Arabic speakers follow the IC conventions Butrus (not Peter).","Prefix ‫بن‬ (bin ‘son of’) is Romanized Bin unless written with an alif, in which case it is Romanized as Ibn. The colloquial form Bu (‘father’) should not be standardized as Abu. These prefixes are capitalized.","In general, Romanization follows the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) form rather than local pronunciation standards. For example, the letter ‫ج‬ (jim) is represented as a j even when pronounced as a “g” (e.g., Egyptian Gamal is Romanized as Jamal)."],"tests":[{"source":"مِصر","expected":"Miṣr"},{"source":"قَطَر","expected":"Qaṭar"},{"source":"المَغرِب","expected":"Al Maghrib"},{"source":"الجُمهُورِيَّة العِراقِيَّة","expected":"Al Jumhuriyah al ’Iraqiyah"},{"source":"جُمهُورِيَّة العِراق","expected":"Jumhuriyat al ’Iraq"},{"source":"جُمهُورِيَّة مِصر العَرَبِيَّة","expected":"Jumhuriyat Miṣr al ’Arabiyah"},{"source":"بَغداد","expected":"Baghdad"},{"source":"تُونِس","expected":"Tunis"},{"source":"حَسّان","expected":"Hassan"},{"source":"مُحَمَّد","expected":"Muhammad"},{"source":"القَذَّافِي","expected":"Al Qadhafi"},{"source":"مُبَشِّر","expected":"Mubashir"},{"source":"الجَزائِر","expected":"Al Jaza’ir"},{"source":"عَبدالرَحمَن","expected":"’Abd al Rahman"},{"source":"هَيْثَم","expected":"Haytham"},{"source":"فَيْصَل","expected":"Fayṣal"},{"source":"تَوْفِيق","expected":"Tawfiq"},{"source":"رَوْضَة","expected":"Rawḍah"},{"source":"نُورُالدِين","expected":"Nur al Din"},{"source":"عَبدُاللَّه","expected":"’Abdallah"}],"map":{"inherit":"odni-ara-Arab-Latn-2015"}}}
