Submitted by the Islamic Republic of\nIran. UNGEGN, 20th session. New York, 17-28 January 2000,\nWorking Paper No. 41.).\n\nThe system is used in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in\ninternational cartographic products.\n\nPersian (Farsi) uses the Perso-Arabic script that is\nwritten from right to left. The Persian script usually\nomits vowel points and diacritical marks from writing which\nmakes it difficult to obtain uniform results in the\nromanization of Persian. The romanization is generally\nreversible though there are some ambiguous letter\nsequences (kh, sh, th, zh) which also may represent the\nromanized values of two Persian characters in addition to\nthe respective single ones.\n","notes":["A Word-initially.","B Not romanized; marks absence of the vowel.","C Doubling of the consonant letter.","D After a consonant (excl. -ah).","E After a vowel (see also note 2).","1-The adjectival ending of Arabic origin -يه in Persian is romanized -īyeh. In romanizing the definite article the same rules of assimilation of consonants are applied as in Arabic, e.g. زين الدين Zeyn od Dīn.","2-The relational suffix (eẕāfeh) -e is usually not expressed in Persian writing after a consonant. After final ا or و it is written with ى, e.g. پاى آب Pā-ye Āb. After final ى and ه it is expressed by writing hamzeh over the character دهانۀ ممبر Dahāneh-ye Mambar.","3-To point Persian vowels two systems are in use that are separated by a column in the table. The first system is a Persian one while the other adheres to the Arabic tradition. In normal spelling vowel points are not used."],"tests":[{"source":"اَنجِيرة","expected":"Anjīrah"},{"source":"اِيْوَانِي","expected":"Eyvānī"},{"source":"آبَادَان","expected":"Ābādān"},{"source":"قُرآن","expected":"Qor’ān"},{"source":"مَآب","expected":"Ma’āb"},{"source":"مُحَمَّد","expected":"Moḩammad"},{"source":"كُوهِ مَرغُوب","expected":"Kūh-e Marghūb"},{"source":"پَايِ آب","expected":"Pā-ye Āb"},{"source":"جُويِ آس","expected":"Jū-ye Ās"},{"source":"دَهَانِهٴ مَمبَر","expected":"Dahāneh-ye Mambar"},{"source":"سَلَسِيٴ بُذُرگ","expected":"Salasī-ye Boz̄org"},{"source":"ذُو الفَقَار","expected":"Z̄ū al Faqār"}],"map":{"postrules":[{"pattern":"(?<=\\b)(?<!\\b[‘|’|'|-])[\\u0061-\\uFFFF]","result":"upcase"},{"pattern":" Al","result":" al"}],"characters":{"\\u064e":"a","\\u064e(?=\\u0629)":"","\\u064e(?=a[h|t])":"","\\u0650":"e","\\u064f":"o","\\u0652":"","\\u064e\\u0627":"ā","\\u064e\\u0649":"á","\\b\\u0622":"ā","\\u0622":"’ā","\\u0650\\u064a":"ī","\\u064f\\u0648":"ū","[\\u064e|\\u0650]\\u064a\\u0652":"ey","[\\u064e|\\u064f]\\u0648\\u0652":"ow","\\u0621":"’","[\\u0654|\\u0674]":"-e","(?<=[\\u064a|\\u0647])[\\u0654|\\u0674]":"-ye","\\u0650\\b":"-e","[\\u064a|\\u06cc]\\u0650\\b":"-ye","\\u0628\\u0651":"bb","\\u062a\\u0651":"tt","\\u062b\\u0651":"s̄s̄","\\u062c\\u0651":"jj","\\u062d\\u0651":"ḩḩ","\\u062e\\u0651":"kh","\\u062f\\u0651":"dd","\\u0630\\u0651":"z̄z̄","\\u0631\\u0651":"rr","\\u0632\\u0651":"zz","\\u0633\\u0651":"ss","\\u0634\\u0651":"sh","\\u0635\\u0651":"şş","\\u0636\\u0651":"ẕẕ","\\u0637\\u0651":"ţţ","\\u0638\\u0651":"z̧z̧","\\u063a\\u0651":"gh","\\u0641\\u0651":"ff","\\u0642\\u0651":"qq","\\u0643\\u0651":"kk","\\u0644\\u0651":"ll","\\u0645\\u0651":"mm","\\u0646\\u0651":"nn","\\u0647\\u0651":"hh","\\u0648\\u0651":"vv","\\u064a\\u0651":"yy","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062a":"ot t","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062b":"os̄ s̄","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u062f":"od d","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0630":"oz̄ z̄","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0631":"or r","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0632":"oz z","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0633":"os s","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0634":"osh sh","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0635":"oş ş","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0636":"oẕ ẕ","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0637":"oţ ţ","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0638":"oz̧ z̧","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644":"ol l","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0646":"on n","\\u0650\\u064a\\u0651\\u064e":"īy","\\u0650\\u064a(?=\\u064e|u064f)":"iy","\\u0629":"at","\\u0629$":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{2})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{3})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{4})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{5})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{6})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{7})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{8})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{9})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{10})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{11})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{12})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{13})\\u0629":"ah","\\b\\u0627\\u0644":"al ","\\b\\u0627":"","\\u0627":"ā","\\u0627\\b":"ā","\\u0628":"b","\\u067E":"p","\\u062A":"t","\\u062B":"s̄","\\u062C":"j","\\u0686":"ch","\\u062D":"ḩ","\\u062E":"kh","\\u062F":"d","\\u0630":"z̄","\\u0631":"r","\\u0632":"z","\\u0698":"zh","\\u0633":"s","\\u0634":"sh","\\u0635":"ş","\\u0636":"ẕ","\\u0637":"ţ","\\u0638":"z̧","\\u0639":"’","\\u063A":"gh","\\u0641":"f","\\u0642":"q","\\u0643":"k","\\u06A9":"k","\\u06AF":"g","\\u0644":"l","\\u0645":"m","\\u0646":"n","\\u0648":"v","\\u0647":"h","\\u0649":"y","\\u064a":"y"}}}}
