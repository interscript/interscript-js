Exceptions:-  Ain and consonants represented by Roman digraphs (e.g., sh, ch) are not doubled:-  Mobasher [ not:-  Mobashsher].  Double letters are only used for tashdid (thus, Hosein [not Hossein]) or to reflect the ‘sun letter’ assimilation (see beelow).","Hamzeh:-  The hamzeh is represented name-internally by an apostrophe, as is the ain.  Name-initially, however, neither hamzeh nor ain are indicated in transliteration ( e.g., Abdorrahman, not 'Abdorrahman).","Digraphs:-  No distinction is drawn in Roman between digraphs such as sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).","Arabic definite article \"al\" ('the'):-  Common in many names borrowed from Arabic, the transliteration should follow the Arabic rules for “sun letter” assimilation in spoken form and reflect the nominative case.  That  is:- Abdorrahman, not Abd al-Rahman.
