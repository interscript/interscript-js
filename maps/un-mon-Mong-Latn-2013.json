In China Mongolian\ngeographical names are transcribed directly from the Mongolian script\ninto Pinyin. The scheme was published in Toponymic Guidelines for Map\nand Other Editors: China, 19821.\n\nThe system is used in China and in international cartographic\nproducts.\n\nMongolian uses a vertical script. Transcription of Mongolian names is\nmade from their proper pronunciation based on the written form of the\nMongolian language and Qahar vernacular, with Zhenglan as its\nrepresentative pronunciation. Due to the complex nature of the script\nthe romanization scheme is not reversible, e.g. the name of the city\nHohhot is written ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ but may be transliterated as kökeqota.\n","notes":["The long and short Mongolian vowels are not distinguished in the spelling for general use, but in recording the pronunciation of place-names, the long vowel is represented by duplication.","Where two Roman equivalents are given, the second (in brackets) is used for recording the pronunciation of place-names while the first form is for general use.","In the table only word-initial character variants are shown. Depending on the position in the word many variants of the characters are used as well as some ligatures. These features are not covered here.","For technical reasons the characters of the Mongolian script are turned 90˚ anti-clockwise."],"tests":[{"source":"ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ","expected":"kökeqota"}],"map":{"rules":[{"pattern":"\\u182c(\\u1821|\\u1825|\\u1826)","result":"k\\1"},{"pattern":"\\u182d(\\u1821|\\u1825|\\u1826)","result":"g\\1"}],"characters":{"ᠠ":"a","ᠪ":"b","ᠼ":"c","ᠲ":"t","ᠳ":"d","ᠡ":"e","ᠹ":"f","ᠭ":"ġ","ᠺ":"k","ᠬ":"q","ᠾ":"h","ᠢ":"i","ᠵ":"j","ᠯ":"l","ᠮ":"m","ᠨ":"n","ᠥ":"ö","ᠫ":"p","ᠴ":"q","ᠷ":"r","ᠰ":"s","ᠦ":"u","ᠸ":"w","ᠱ":"x","ᠶ":"y","ᠽ":"z","ᠣ":"o","ᠤ":"u","ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ":"kökeqota"}}}
