When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n -  Vowel hiatus, not digraph transliteration of diphthongs; as in Sanskrit pra:uga (not prauga), “yoke”;\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."],"tests":[{"source":"पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्ण्मुदच्यते","expected":"paūraṇamadaḥ paūraṇamaidaṁ paūraṇaāta paūraṇamaudacayatae"},{"source":"पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते","expected":"paūraṇasaya paūraṇamaādaāya paūraṇamaevaāvaśaiṣayatae"},{"source":"यथा चतुर्भिः कनकं परीक्ष्यते निर्घषणच्छेदन तापताडनैः","expected":"yathaā cataurabhaiḥ kanakaṁ paraīkaṣayatae nairaghaṣaṇacachaedana taāpataāḍanaaiḥ"},{"source":"तथा चतुर्भिः पुरुषः परीक्ष्यते त्यागेन शीलेन गुणेन कर्मणा","expected":"tathaā cataurabhaiḥ paurauṣaḥ paraīkaṣayatae tayaāgaena śaīlaena gauṇaena karamaṇaā"},{"source":"यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्‍क्षति","expected":"yao na haṛṣayatai na davaeṣaṭai na śaocatai na kaāṅakaṣatai"},{"source":"शुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्यः स मे प्रियः","expected":"śaubhaāśaubhaparaitayaāgaī bhakataimaānayaḥ sa mae paraiyaḥ"},{"source":"सत्य -सत्यमेवेश्वरो लोके सत्ये धर्मः सदाश्रितः","expected":"sataya -satayamaevaeśavarao laokae satayae dharamaḥ sadaāśaraitaḥ"},{"source":"सत्यमूलनि सर्वाणि सत्यान्नास्ति परं पदम्","expected":"satayamaūlanai saravaāṇai satayaānanaāsatai paraṁ padama"},{"source":"पिता माताग्निरात्मा च गुरुश्च भरतर्षभ","expected":"paitaā maātaāganairaātamaā ca gaurauśaca bharataraṣabha"},{"source":"पल्यालँ","expected":"palayaām̐la"},{"source":"दुसूलँ","expected":"dausaūm̐la"}],"map":{"characters":{"अ":"a","आ":"ā","इ":"i","ई":"ī","उ":"u","ऊ":"ū","ऋ":"ṛ","ॠ":"ṝ","ऌ":"ḷ","ॡ":"ḹ","ए":"e","ऐ":"ai","ओ":"o","औ":"au","ऍ":"ê","ऑ":"ô","क":"ka","ख":"kha","ग":"ga","घ":"gha","ङ":"ṅa","च":"ca","छ":"cha","ज":"ja","झ":"jha","ञ":"ña","ट":"ṭa","ठ":"ṭha","ड":"ḍa","ढ":"ḍha","ण":"ṇa","त":"ta","थ":"tha","द":"da","ध":"dha","न":"na","प":"pa","फ":"pha","ब":"ba","भ":"bha","म":"ma","य":"ya","र":"ra","ल":"la","ळ":"ḷa","व":"va","श":"śa","ष":"ṣa","स":"sa","ह":"ha","ᳵ":"ẖ","ᳶ":"ḫ","ं":"ṁ","ः":"ḥ","ँ":"m̐","ऽ":":’","ा":"ā","ि":"i","ी":"ī","ु":"u","ू":"ū","ॢ":"ḷ","ॣ":"ḹ","ृ":"ṛ","ॄ":"ṝ","े":"e","ै":"ai","ो":"o","ौ":"au","ॉ":"ô","ॅ":"ê","्":"","‍":"","यँ":"m̐ya","रँ":"m̐ra","लँ":"m̐la","ळँ":"m̐ḷa","वँ":"m̐va","०":"0","१":"1","२":"2","३":"3","४":"4","५":"5","६":"6","७":"7","८":"8","९":"9","स़":"s̱a","ह़":"ẓa","ख़":"k͟ha","ज़":"za","त़":"t̤a","ग़":"ġa","फ़":"fa","क़":"qa","व़":"wa","ड़":"ṛa","ढ़":"ṛha"}}}}
