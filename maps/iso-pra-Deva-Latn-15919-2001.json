When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."],"tests":[{"source":"सृष्टिस्थितिविनाशानां शक्तिभूते सनातनि","expected":"saṛṣaṭaisathaitaivainaāśaānaāṁ śakataibhaūtae sanaātanai"},{"source":"गुणाश्रये गुणमये नारायणि नमोऽस्तु ते","expected":"gauṇaāśarayae gauṇamayae naāraāyaṇai namao:’satau tae"},{"source":"तेन समयेन बुद्धो भगवा सावत्थियं विहरति जेतवने अनाथपिण्डिकस्स आरामे","expected":"taena samayaena baudadhao bhagavaā saāvatathaiyaṁ vaiharatai jaetavanae anaāthapaiṇaḍaikasasa āraāmae"}],"map":{"inherit":"iso-san-Deva-Latn-15919-2001"}}}
