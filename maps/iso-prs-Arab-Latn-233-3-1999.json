The aim of this part of ISO 233 and others in the\nseries is to provide a means for international\ncommunication of written messages in a form which permits\nthe automatic transmission and reconstitution of these, by\nmen or machines. The system of conversion, in this case,\nmust be univocal and entirely reversible. This means that\nno consideration should be given to phonetic and aesthetic\nmatters or to certain national customs: all these\nconsiderations are, indeed, ignored by the machine\nperforming the function. The adoption of this part of ISO\n233 for international communication leaves every country\nfree to adopt for its own use a national standard which may\nbe different, on condition that it is compatible with this\npart of ISO 233. The system proposed herein should make\nthis possible and be acceptable to international use if the\ngraphisms it creates are such that they may be converted\nautomatically into the graphisms used in any strict\nnational systems. This part of ISO 233 may be used by\nanyone who has a clear understanding of the system and is\ncertain that it can be applied without ambiguity. The\nresult obtained will not give a correct pronunciation of\nthe original text in a person’s own language, but it will\nserve as a means of finding automatically the original\ngraphism and thus allow anyone who has knowledge of the\noriginal language to pronounce it correctly. Similarly, one\ncan only pronounce correctly a text written in, for\nexample, English or Polish, if one has a knowledge of\nEnglish or Polish. The adoption of national standards\ncompatible with this part of ISO 233 will permit the\nrepresentation, in an international publication, of the\nmorphemes of each language according to the customs of the\ncountry where it is spoken. It will be possible to simplify\nthis representation in order to take into account the\nnumber of the character sets available on different kinds\nof machines.\n1-Scope:\nThis part of ISO 233 establishes a simplified\nsystem for the transliteration of Persian characters into\nLatin characters. This simplification of the stringent\nrules established by ISO 233:1984 is especially intended to\nfacilitate the processing of bibliographic information (\ne.g. catalogues, indices, citations, etc.)\n2-Normative references:\nThe following normative documents contain\nprovisions which, though reference in this text, constitute\nprovisions of this part of ISO 233. For dated references,\nsubsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any of these\npublications do not apply. However, parties to agreements\nbased on this part of ISO 233 are encouraged to investigate\nthe possibility of applying the most recent editions of the\nnormative documents indicated below. For undated\nreferences, the latest edition of the normative document\nreferred to applies.
