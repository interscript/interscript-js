The romanization system is based on\nthe Hunterian system of romanization, which has been\nused by the Surveys of India and Pakistan for\nromanizing Baluchi geographic names for more than one\nhundred years. The romanization system is compatible\nwith all dialects of Baluchi, including Eastern\nBaluchi, Western Baluchi, and Southern Baluchi.\n\nThe BGN/PCGN system laid out below includes diacritical\nmarks in order that the original script can be derived\nfrom the romanized form (i.e. it is reversible). For\ndesk users requiring a diacritic-free form, these\ndiacritics can simply be removed. In almost every case\nthe same basic Roman-script characters are kept as are\nused in the Hunterian system. The BGN/PCGN forms have\nfurther been designed to harmonize with the BGN/PCGN\nUrdu romanization system. In rigorous romanization\n(i.e. including diacritics), retroflexion is marked by\na sub-dot, and aspiration is marked by an apostrophe,\nwhere confusion with fricative digraphs could arise.\nFor letters used only in Arabic loan words, the\nrigorous forms have further been designed to harmonize\nwith the BGN/PCGN Persian romanization system.\n","notes":["Occasionally, sequences of /z/ or /s/ plus /h/ may be encountered, i.e. z·h, s·h. These may be romanized with the Unicode 'center dot' (U+00B7) separating the two letters, to distinguish them from the digraphs /zh/ and /sh/.","The character ة is found very rarely in Baluchi, principally in certain Arabic religious terms, e.g. zakāt ('alms'). It should be romanized t.","When the letters ال are found, representing the Arabic definite article, the ل is assimilated to a following 'sun letter' ,د ,ث ,ت ل ,ظ ,ط , ض , ,ص ,ش ,س , ,ر ,ذ or ن and is romanized t, , d, , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ ţ z , l, n accordingly.","In romanization, the suffixes ءَ (-ā, singular definite) and ءِ (-ay, possessive) are connected to the previous word by a hyphen, though they are usually written separately.","The word for 'and', written as و or ءُ, should be romanized as –u-, linked by hyphens to the two words it connects; e.g., ہ ٹد و س ٹد → Sind-u-Hind ('The Gangetic Plain').","Except as specified in notes 4 and 5, word division in romanization should follow word division in the Baluchi script.","Note that the short vowels in the Baluchi examples are not pointed.","Certain initial, medial and final characters are not readily available in a Unicode-encoded font in a standalone form.","The Romanization columns show only lowercase forms but, when romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should be used."],"tests":[{"source":"بےنٹَگ","expected":"Benṭag"},{"source":"جاپان","expected":"Jāpān"},{"source":"اَرَبِستان","expected":"Arabistān"},{"source":"بُنجاه","expected":"Bunjāh"},{"source":"بَلوچِستان","expected":"Balochistān"},{"source":"حَلق","expected":"Ḩalq"},{"source":"دامان","expected":"Dāmān"},{"source":"ڈاڈَر","expected":"Ḍāḍar"},{"source":"گُمبُذ","expected":"Gumbud͟h"},{"source":"چار راہ","expected":"Chār Rāh"},{"source":"بازار","expected":"Bāzār"},{"source":"سےبِى","expected":"Sebī"},{"source":"عَبّاس","expected":"‘Abbās"},{"source":"فارموسا","expected":"Fārmosā"},{"source":"ڈاک","expected":"Ḍāk"},{"source":"مَلّ","expected":"Mall"},{"source":"فِلپائِن","expected":"Filpā’in"},{"source":"مُرگاپ","expected":"Murgāp"}],"map":{"postrules":[{"pattern":"(?<=\\b)(?<!\\b[‘|’|'])[\\u0061-\\uFFFF]","result":"upcase"}],"characters":{"\\u0628":"b","\\u067E":"p","\\u062a":"t","\\u0679":"ṭ","\\u067C":"ṭ","\\u062B":"t͟h","\\u067F":"t͟h","\\u062c":"j","\\u0686":"ch","\\u062d":"ḩ","\\u062e":"kh","\\u062f":"d","\\u0688":"ḍ","\\u0689":"ḍ","\\u0630":"d͟h","\\u0631":"r","\\u0691":"ṛ","\\u0693":"ṛ","\\u0632":"z","\\u0698":"zh","\\u0633":"s","\\u0634":"sh","\\u0635":"ş","\\u0636":"ẕ","\\u0637":"ţ","\\u0638":"z̧","\\u0639":"‘","\\u063a":"gh","\\u0641":"f","\\u0642":"q","\\u0643":"k","\\u06A9":"k","\\u06AF":"g","\\u0644":"l","\\u0645":"m","\\u0646":"n","\\u06BA":"ñ","\\u0648":"o","\\u0647":"h","\\u06C1":"h","\\u06BE":"h","\\u0621":"’","\\u0626":"’","\\u0649":"y","\\u064A":"y","\\u0628\\u06BE":"bh","\\u067E\\u06BE":"ph","\\u062A\\u06BE":"th’","\\u0679\\u06BE":"ṭh","\\u062C\\u06BE":"jh","\\u0686\\u06BE":"chh","\\u062D\\u06BE":"dh’","\\u0688\\u06BE":"ḍh","\\u0631\\u06BE":"\\u1E5B\\u0068","\\u06A9\\u06BE":"kh’","\\u06AF\\u06BE":"gh’","\\u0644\\u0627":"lā","\\u06A9\\u0627":"kā","\\u06AF\\u0627":"gā","\\u06A9\\u0644":"kl","\\u06AF\\u0644":"gl","\\u0650\\u0649":"ī","\\u0650":"i","\\u06D2":"e","\\b\\u0627":"","\\u0627":"ā","\\u0622":"ā","\\u064E":"a","\\u064F":"u","\\u064F\\u0648":"ū","\\u064E\\u06D2":"ay","\\u064E\\u0648":"aw","\\u0652":"","\\u0670":"á","\\u0628\\u0651":"bb","\\u067E\\u0651":"pp","\\u062a\\u0651":"tt","\\u0679\\u0651":"ṭṭ","\\u067C\\u0651":"ṭṭ","\\u062B\\u0651":"t͟ht͟h","\\u067F\\u0651":"t͟ht͟h","\\u062c\\u0651":"jj","\\u0686\\u0651":"chch","\\u062d\\u0651":"ḩḩ","\\u062e\\u0651":"khkh","\\u062f\\u0651":"dd","\\u0688\\u0651":"ḍḍ","\\u0689\\u0651":"ḍḍ","\\u0630\\u0651":"d͟hd͟h","\\u0631\\u0651":"rr","\\u0691\\u0651":"ṛṛ","\\u0693\\u0651":"ṛṛ","\\u0632\\u0651":"zz","\\u0698\\u0651":"zhzh","\\u0633\\u0651":"ss","\\u0634\\u0651":"shsh","\\u0635\\u0651":"şş","\\u0636\\u0651":"ẕẕ","\\u0637\\u0651":"ţţ","\\u0638\\u0651":"z̧z̧","\\u0639\\u0651":"‘‘","\\u063a\\u0651":"ghgh","\\u0641\\u0651":"ff","\\u0642\\u0651":"qq","\\u0643\\u0651":"kk","\\u06A9\\u0651":"kk","\\u06AF\\u0651":"gg","\\u0644\\u0651":"ll","\\u0645\\u0651":"mm","\\u0646\\u0651":"nn","\\u06BA\\u0651":"ññ","\\u0648\\u0651":"ww","\\u0647\\u0651":"hh","\\u06C1\\u0651":"hh","\\u06BE\\u0651":"hh","\\u0621\\u0651":"’’","\\u0626\\u0651":"’’","\\u0649\\u0651":"yy","\\u0621\\u064E":"-ā","\\u0621\\u0650":"-ay","۰":"0","۱":"1","۲":"2","۳":"3","۴":"4","۵":"5","۶":"6","۷":"7","۸":"8","۹":"9"}}}}
