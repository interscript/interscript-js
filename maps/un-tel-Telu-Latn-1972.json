N. Sharma. The tables and their corrections were published in volume II\nof the conference reports.\n\nThere is no evidence of the use of the system either in India or in international cartographic products.\n\nTelugu uses an alphasyllabic script whereby each character represents a syllable rather than one sound.\nVowels and diphthongs are marked in two ways: as independent characters (used syllable-initially) and in\nan abbreviated form, to denote vowels after consonants. The romanization table is unambiguous. The system is\nmostly reversible but there may exist some ambiguities in the romanization of vowels (independent vs. abbreviated characters)\nand consonants (combinations with subscript consonants vs. character sequences).\n","notes":["Only the vowel forms that appear at the beginning of a syllable are listed; the forms used for\nvowels following a consonant can be found in grammars; no distinction between the two is\nmade in transliteration.\n","The vowel a is implicit after all consonants and consonant clusters and is supplied in\ntransliteration, with the following exceptions:\na) when another vowel is indicated by its appropriate sign; and\nb) when the absence of any vowel is indicated by the superscript sign ( ౬ ) called valapalagilaka.\n","Exception: Sunna is transliterated by:\na) ṅ before gutturals,\nb) ñ before palatals,\nc) ṇ before cerebrals,\nd) n before dentals, and\ne) m before labials.\n","Ardhasunna before gutturals and palatal, cerebral, and dental occlusives is transliterated n̐.\nBefore labials, sibilants, semivowels, the aspirate, vowels, and in final position it is\ntransliterated m\n"],"tests":[{"source":"తమిళనాడు","expected":"tamiḷanāḍu"},{"source":"తంటికొండ ఘటన: ఆగని మృత్యుఘోష","expected":"taṃṭikŏṃḍa ghaṭana: āgani mṛtyughoṣha"},{"source":"మళ్లీ వివాదం: అమితాబ్‌పై
