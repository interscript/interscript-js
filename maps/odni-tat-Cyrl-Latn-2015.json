{"odni-tat-Cyrl-Latn-2015":{"authority_id":"odni","id":2015,"language":"iso-639-2:tat","source_script":"Cyrl","destination_script":"Latn","name":"Standards for the transliteration of tatar personal names in written reports and products","source":"ICS-630-01 Annex S","creation_date":2015,"confirmation_date":2015,"description":"This system is the Intelligence Community standard for the transliteration of Tatar person names\nthat will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC consumers. It is not intended\nto eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Tatar that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nRustam Abdrashitov (also seen as Rustem Abdrashitov, Рустам Абдрашитов). This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Tatar-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n","notes":["Transliterate double digraphs as a single digraph, i.e. шш -> sh, not shsh","In the Roman, no distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh' and single contiguous letters, (e.g. 's' followed by 'h').","The Cyrillic ъ and ь are not transliterated, but instead are left out of the transliteration."],"tests":[{"source":"Рустам Абдрашитов","expected":"Rustam Abdrashitov"}],"map":{"rules":[{"pattern":"(?i)(Ё|Ж|Ң|Х|Ц|Ч|Ш|Щ|Ю|Я)\\1(?-i)","result":"\\1"},{"pattern":"\\u044A|\\u044C","result":""}],"characters":{"\\u0410":"A","\\u04D8":"A","\\u0411":"B","\\u0412":"V","\\u0413":"G","\\u0414":"D","\\u0415":"E","\\u0401":"Yo","\\u0416":"Zh","\\u0496":"J","\\u0417":"Z","\\u0418":"I","\\u0419":"Y","\\u041A":"K","\\u041B":"L","\\u041C":"M","\\u041D":"N","\\u04A2":"Ng","\\u041E":"O","\\u04E8":"O","\\u041F":"P","\\u0420":"R","\\u0421":"S","\\u0422":"T","\\u0423":"U","\\u04AE":"U","\\u0424":"F","\\u0425":"Kh","\\u04BA":"H","\\u0426":"Ts","\\u0427":"Ch","\\u0428":"Sh","\\u0429":"Shch","\\u042B":"Y","\\u042D":"E","\\u042E":"Yu","\\u042F":"Ya","\\u0430":"a","\\u04D9":"a","\\u0431":"b","\\u0432":"v","\\u0433":"g","\\u0434":"d","\\u0435":"e","\\u0451":"yo","\\u0436":"zh","\\u0497":"j","\\u0437":"z","\\u0438":"i","\\u0439":"y","\\u043A":"k","\\u043B":"l","\\u043C":"m","\\u043D":"n","\\u04A3":"ng","\\u043E":"o","\\u04E9":"o","\\u043F":"p","\\u0440":"r","\\u0441":"s","\\u0442":"t","\\u0443":"u","\\u04AF":"u","\\u0444":"f","\\u0445":"kh","\\u04BB":"h","\\u0446":"ts","\\u0447":"ch","\\u0448":"sh","\\u0449":"shch","\\u044B":"y","\\u044D":"e","\\u044E":"yu","\\u044F":"ya"}}}}
