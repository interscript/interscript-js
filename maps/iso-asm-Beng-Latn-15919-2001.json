When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."],"tests":[{"source":"অসমীয়া কবিতা","expected":"asamaīẏaā kabaitaā"},{"source":"কবিৰ আজি জন্মদিন","expected":"kabaiva ājai janamadaina"},{"source":"বেৰুটত এমাহৰ পাছতে পুনৰ ভয়ংকৰ অগ্নিকাণ্ড","expected":"baevauṭata emaāhava paāchatae paunava bhaya়ṁkava aganaikaāṇaḍa"},{"source":"ভঙাৰ বিৰুদ্ধে আৱেদন দাখিল কংগনাৰ","expected":"bhaṅaāva baivaudadhae āraedana daākhaila kaṁganaāva"},{"source":"আপুনি পঢ়ি ভাল পাব পৰা বাতৰি","expected":"āpaunai paṙhai bhaāla paāba pavaā baātavai"},{"source":"শ্ৰীৰামপুৰত গৰুভৰ্তি ট্ৰাক জব্দ, দুজনক আটক","expected":"śavaīvaāmapauvata gavaubhavatai ṭavaāka jabada, daujanaka āṭaka"},{"source":"কেনে আছে প্ৰাক্তন","expected":"kaenae āchae pavaākatana"},{"source":"কমুম্বাইৰ মেয়ৰৰ দেহত কোভিড পজিটিভ","expected":"kamaumabaāiva maeẏavava daehata kaobhaiḍa pajaiṭaibha"},{"source":"টুইটাৰযোগে খোদ সদৰী কৰে এই কথা","expected":"ṭauiṭaāvayaogae khaoda sadavaī kavae ei kathaā"},{"source":"লখিমপুৰ জিলাৰ নাৰায়ণপুৰৰ বৰপথাৰত আজি প্ৰশান্তি ধাম নামেৰে এখন বৃদ্ধাশ্ৰমৰ শুভাৰম্ভ কৰা হয়","expected":"lakhaimapauva jailaāva naāvaāẏaṇapauvava bavapathaāvata ājai pavaśaānatai dhaāma naāmaevae ekhana baṛdadhaāśavamava śaubhaāvamabha kavaā haẏa"}],"map":{"inherit":"iso-ben-Beng-Latn-15919-2001","characters":{"ৰ":"va","ৱ":"ra"}}}}
