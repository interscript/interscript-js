The table was published in volume\nII of the conference report.\nIn UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the\nsystem was recommended for the “romanization of the\ngeographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries\nwhere this system is officially adopted”. There is\nevidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization\nSystems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s\nimplementation across Arabic-speaking countries.\nIn some countries there exist local romanization schemes\nor practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,\nMauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in\nthe traditional manner which conforms to the principles of\nthe French orthography.\nThe previous UN-approved system is still found in\nconsiderable international usage.\nArabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script\nusually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from\nwriting which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results\nin the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify\ncorrectly the words which appear in any particular name\nand to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including\nthe relevant vowels. One must also take into account\ndialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization\nis generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous\nletter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to\ncombinations of Arabic characters in addition to the\nrespective single characters.\n","notes":["When the definite article al precedes a word beginning with\none of the \"sun letters\" (t, th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, s̱, ḏ, ṯ,\nd͟h, l, n) the l of the definite article is assimilated with\nthe first consonant of the word: الشارقة Ash Shāriqah.\n","The definite article is always written with a capital\ninitial: الزيتون Az Zaytūn, البلد Al Balad, منية الضنية Minyat Aḏ\nḎinniyyah.\n","Nunation is unlikely to be found in geographical names and\nthe last letter remains silent: جبل = جبلٌ Jabal (not Jabalun).\n","In order to disambiguate certain character sequences a\nmiddle dot (·) may be used: سهيلة S·haylah (cf. شيلة Shaylah), دهيب\nD·hayb (cf. ذيب Dhayb), أدهم Ad·ham (cf. أذم Adham).\n","ta' marboota should be transliterated to 'ah' if it's in\na definite article, or at the end of the sentence\notherwise it should be transliterated to 'at'\nto handle words starting with AL and ending with ta' marboota\nwhich is pronounced as \"ah\" not \"at\" divided into multiple\nregex because lookbehind in ruby doesn't support variable length\n","مَكّة should be transliterated to makkah, shadda above ك\nis to double the consonant, same
