It is not\nintended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to\nprovide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Belarusian that can then be\nlinked to forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing organization\nand taking into consideration information system capabilities. This convention is designed to\nensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Belarusian-speaking community, use\nthe relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use\nof diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name\n","notes":null,"tests":[{"source":"Міхаіл","expected":"Mikhail"},{"source":"Беларусь","expected":"Byelarus"},{"source":"Кастусь Каліноўскі","expected":"Kastus Kalinowski"},{"source":"Васіль Быкау","expected":"Vasil Bykau"},{"source":"Янка Купала","expected":"Yanka Kupala"},{"source":"Маланка","expected":"Malanka"},{"source":"Пакаранне","expected":"Pakarannye"},{"source":"Бэз","expected":"Bez"},{"source":"Чабор","expected":"Chabor"},{"source":"Дзяўчына, дзяўчыначка пасярод гісторыі\nЗ прастадушнай шчырасьцю глядзіць на тэрыторыю.\nУ вакне заўсёды звыклая выява:\nШэры двор, шэры слуп, на слупе аб'явы.\n","expected":"Dzyawchyna, dzyawchynachka pasyarod historyi\nZ prastadushnay shchyrastsyu hlyadzits na terytoryyu.\nU vaknye zawsyody zvyklaya vyyava:\nShery dvor, shery slup, na slupye abyavy.\n"}],"map":{"characters":{"\\u0027":"","\\u0410":"A","\\u0411":"B","\\u0412":"V","\\u0413":"H","\\u0490":"G","\\u0414":"D","\\u0415":"Ye","\\u0401":"Yo","\\u0416":"Zh","\\u0417":"Z","\\u0406":"I","\\u0419":"Y","\\u041A":"K","\\u041B":"L","\\u041C":"M","\\u041D":"N","\\u041E":"O","\\u041F":"P","\\u0420":"R","\\u0421":"S","\\u0422":"T","\\u0423":"U","\\U040E":"W","\\u0424":"F","\\u0425":"Kh","\\u0426":"Ts","\\u0427":"Ch","\\u0428":"Sh","\\u042B":"Y","\\u042C":"","\\u042D":"E","\\u042E":"Yu","\\u042F":"Ya","\\u0430":"a","\\u0431":"b","\\u0432":"v","\\u0433":"h","\\u0491":"g","\\u0434":"d","\\u0435":"ye","\\u0451":"yo","\\u0436":"zh","\\u0437":"z","\\u0456":"i","\\u0439":"y","\\u043A":"k","\\u043B":"l","\\u043C":"m","\\u043D":"n","\\u043E":"o","\\u043F":"p","\\u0440":"r","\\u0441":"s","\\u0442":"t","\\u0443":"u","\\u045E":"w","\\u0444":"f","\\u0445":"kh","\\u0446":"ts","\\u0447":"ch","\\u0448":"sh","\\u044B":"y","\\u044c":"","\\u044D":"e","\\u044E":"yu","\\u044F":"ya"}}}}
