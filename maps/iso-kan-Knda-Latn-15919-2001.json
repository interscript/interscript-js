When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."],"tests":[{"source":"ಈಗ ವೈರಲ್ ಆಗುತ್ತಿದೆ ಕಂಗನಾ ರಣಾವುತ್ ಹಳೇಯ ವಿಡಿಯೋ","expected":"īga vaairala āgautataidae kaṁganaā raṇaāvauta haḷaēya vaiḍaiyaō"},{"source":"ಸಂಕಷ್ಟ ಎದುರಾದರೆ ಬಿಎಸ್‌ವೈ ಬೆನ್ನಿಗೆ ಎಚ್‌ಡಿಕೆ ?","expected":"saṁkaṣaṭa edauraādarae baiesavaai baenanaigae ecaḍaikae ?"},{"source":"ಶಾಸಕರಿಂದಲೂ ಒತ್ತಡ?","expected":"śaāsakaraiṁdalaū otataḍa?"},{"source":"ಏಕೆಂದರೆ, ಇವರ ಹೆಸರೇ ಕೊರೊನಾ!","expected":"ēkaeṁdarae, ivara haesaraē kaeūraonaā!"},{"source":"ಕೊರೊನಾಕ್ಕಿಂತಲೂ ಮುಂಚೆಯೇ ಅವರು ಕೊರೊನಾ ಆಗಿದ್ದವರು!","expected":"kaeūraonaākakaiṁtalaū mauṁcaeyaē avarau kaeūraonaā āgaidadavarau!"},{"source":"ಕೇರಳದ ಕೊಟ್ಟಾಯಂನ ಮಹಿಳೆಯೊಬ್ಬರು ಈಗ ತಮ್ಮ ಹೆಸರು ಹೇಳಲು ಮುಜುಗರ ಪಡುವಂತಾಗಿದೆ","expected":"kaēraḷada kaeūṭaṭaāyaṁna mahaiḷaeyaobabarau īga tamama haesarau haēḷalau maujaugara paḍauvaṁtaāgaidae"},{"source":"ಬೇರೆ ಬೆಳವಣಿಗೆಗೆ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿ ಸಾಧ್ಯತೆ","expected":"baērae baeḷavaṇaigaegae saākaṣai saādhayatae"},{"source":"ಗುರು ಶನಿ ಗ್ರಹಗಳ ನಡುವೆ 3 ಜನರ ಪ್ರಯಾಣ","expected":"gaurau śanai garahagaḷa naḍauvae 3 janara parayaāṇa"},{"source":"ಕೊರೊನಾ ಬಿಕ್ಕಟ್ಟಿನ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ “ಮಿಸೆಸ್‌ ಕೊರೊನಾ’ಗೆ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆ!","expected":"kaeūraonaā baikakaṭaṭaina kaāladalalai “maisaesa kaeūraonaā’gae samasayae!"},{"source":"ಕೆಲವು ತಿಂಗಳಿಂದ ರಷ್ಯಾ ದೇಶದ ಏನಾಟೊಲಿ ಇವ್ಯಾನಿಶಿನ್‌ ಮತ್ತು ಇವಾನ್‌ ವ್ಯಾಗನರ್‌ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಮೆರಿಕಾದ ಕ್ರಿಸ್‌ ಕ್ಯಾಸಿಡಿ ಈ ಉಪಗ್ರಹದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಸಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ","expected":"kaelavau taiṁgaḷaiṁda raṣayaā daēśada ēnaāṭaeūlai ivayaānaiśaina matatau ivaāna vayaāganara haāgaū amaeraikaāda karaisa kayaāsaiḍai ī upagarahadalalai vaāsaisautataidadaārae"},{"source":"ಹಾಂಗ್ ಕಾಂಗ್","expected":"haāṁga kaāṁga"},{"source":"೧೮೧೪೦","expected":"18140"}],"map":{"characters":{"ಅ":"a","ಆ":"ā","ಇ":"i","ಈ":"ī","ಉ":"u","ಊ":"ū","ಋ":"ṛ","ೠ":"ṝ","ಌ":"ḻ","ೡ":"ḹ","ಎ":"e","ಏ":"ē","ಐ":"ai","ಒ":"o","ಓ":"ō","ಔ":"au","ಕ":"ka","ಖ":"kha","ಗ":"ga","ಘ":"gha","ಙ":"ṅa","ಚ":"ca","ಛ":"cha","ಜ":"ja","ಝ":"jha","ಞ":"ña","ಟ":"ṭa","ಠ":"ṭha","ಡ":"ḍa","ಢ":"ḍha","ಣ":"ṇa","ತ":"ta","ಥ":"tha","ದ":"da","ಧ":"dha","ನ":"na","ಪ":"pa","ಫ":"pha","ಬ":"ba","ಭ":"bha","ಮ":"ma","ಯ":"ya","ರ":"ra","ಱ":"ṟa","ಲ":"la","ಳ":"ḷa","ವ":"va","ಶ":"śa","ಷ":"ṣa","ಸ":"sa","ಹ":"ha","ಜ಼":"za","ಫ಼":"fa","ಃ":"ḥ","ೱ":"ẖ","ೲ":"ḫ","\\u0C80":"m̐","\\u0C81":"m̐","ಽ":":’","ಂ":"ṁ","಼":"","ಾ":"ā","ಿ":"i","ೀ":"ī","ು":"u","ೂ":"ū","ೃ":"ṛ","ೄ":"ṝ"," ೢ":"ḷ"," ೣ":"ḹ","ೆ":"e","ೇ":"ē","ೈ":"ai","ೊ":"o","ೋ":"ō","ೌ":"au","्":"","़":"","್":"","‍":"","‌":"","ಯಀ":"m̐ya","ರಀ":"m̐ra","ಱಀ":"m̐ṟa","ಲಀ":"m̐la","ಳಀ":"m̐ḷa","ವಀ":"m̐va","೧":"1","೨":"2","೩":"3","೪":"4","೫":"5","೬":"6","೭":"7","೮":"8","೯":"9","೦":"0"}}}}
