When m̐ is associated with a semivowel, it shall be placed before the semivowel.","Latin punctuation signs and Hindu-Arabic numerals shall remain unchanged in transliteration. Indic punctuation is outside the scope of this International Standard.","The Vedic accent Udatta shall be transliterated as an acute accent over the transliterated vowel, and the independent Svarita as a grave accent over the transliterated vowel. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, the accent shall be attached to the second vowel.","A colon: before a Latin character shall be used to resolve ambiguity. Some normative cases are as\nfollows.\n -  :’ for avagraha in modern text. (The apostrophe in modern text remains unchanged in accordance with previous rule.\n - Removal of ambiguity in the limited character set option. Tamil perii:i:iya, “really big”, separating the vowels.\n - Gurmukhi Adhik before a vowel, as in bac: ā (not bacā without Adhik).\n - Gurmukhi Bindi or Tippi written before the vowel ī (instead of after the vowel) in old orthography, transliterated\nas ī:ṃ or ī:ṁ , respectively.\n - Gurmukhi hala making a conjunct h in old orthography, as in tum:ha formed with hala (not tumha formed with the usual subscript h).\n","If a character in an Indic script is defined in such a way as to be equivalent to another character in any script, where the second character has a transliteration in this International Standard, then the first character shall be transliterated in the same way as the second character.","Where it is desired to show the Vedic accent Anudatta, it should be transliterated as an underscore. In the case of the digraphs ai, au, both Latin vowels should be underscored. Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."],"tests":[{"source":"ਪੰਜਾਬ 'ਚ ਵਧ ਰਿਹਾ ਖ਼ੁਦਕੁਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਰੁਝਾਨ","expected":"paṁjaāba 'ca vadha raihaā ḵẖaudakauśaīāṃ daā raujhaāna"},{"source":"ਲੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਪਾਰ ਪੁੱਜਾ ਸਰਗਰਮ ਕੇਸਾਂ ਦਾ ਅੰਕੜਾ, ਦਿੱਲੀ 'ਚ ਦੋ ਲੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਪਾਰ ਇਨਫੈਕਟਿਡ","expected":"lakha taoṃ paāra paujaā saragarama kaesaāṃ daā aṁkaṛaā, dailaī 'ca dao lakha taoṃ paāra inaphaaikaṭaiḍa"},{"source":"ਪਰਿਵਾਰਕ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਆਹ ਵੀ ਹੈ ਹੋਰ ਅਹਿਮ ਕਾਰਨ","expected":"paraivaāraka samasaiāvaāṃ atae vaiāha vaī haai haora ahaima kaārana"},{"source":"ਮਰਦਾਂ 'ਚ ਔਰਤਾਂ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਹੈ ਖ਼ੁਦਕੁਸ਼ੀ ਦਾ ਰੁਝਾਨ","expected":"maradaāṃ 'ca aurataāṃ naālaoṃ vadha haai ḵẖaudakauśaī daā raujhaāna"},{"source":"ਰਾਸ਼ਟਰੀ ਪੱਧਰ 'ਤੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਸਥਿਤੀ ਕਾਫ਼ੀ ਸੂਬਿਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਹਤਰ","expected":"raāśaṭaraī padhara 'tae paṁjaāba daī sathaitaī kaāfaī saūbaiāṃ taoṃ baihatara"},{"source":"ਚੀਨੀ ਸੈਨਾ ਨੇ ਲਾਪਤਾ ਅਰੁਣਾਚਲ ਦੇ 5 ਨੌਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਦੱਸਿਆ","expected":"caīnaī saainaā nae laāpataā arauṇaācala dae 5 naaujavaānaāṃ baārae dasaiā"},{"source":"ਸਾਖਰਤਾ ਦੇ ਮਾਮਲੇ 'ਚ ਦੇਸ਼ 'ਚ 7ਵੇਂ ਨੰਬਰ 'ਤੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ","expected":"saākharataā dae maāmalae 'ca daeśa 'ca 7vaeṃ naṁbara 'tae paṁjaāba"},{"source":"ਦਿੱਲੀ ਕਮੇਟੀ ਦੇ ਮੈਂਬਰ ਸ਼ੰਟੀ ਨੇ ਅਕਾਲੀ ਦਲ ਤੋਂ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਅਸਤੀਫ਼ਾ","expected":"dailaī kamaeṭaī dae maaiṃbara śaṁṭaī nae akaālaī dala taoṃ daitaā asataīfaā"},{"source":"੧੦੨ ਹੋਰ ਕੋਰੋਨਾ ਪਾਜ਼ੀਟਿਵ ਮਰੀਜ਼ਾਂ ਦੀ ਪੁਸ਼ਟੀ, ਇਕ ਦੀ ਮੌਤ","expected":"102 haora kaoraonaā paāzaīṭaiva maraīzaāṃ daī pauśaṭaī, ika daī maauta"},{"source":"ਸੜਕ ਹਾਦਸੇ ਦੌਰਾਨ ਇਕ ਦੀ ਮੌਤ","expected":"saṛaka haādasae daauraāna ika daī maauta"},{"source":"ਅਸੀਂ ਲੁੱਕ ਛੁੱਪ ਕ਼ ਆਪਣੀ ਜਾਨ","expected":"asaīṃ lauka chaupa qa āpaṇaī jaāna"}],"map":{"characters":{"ਅ":"a","ਆ":"ā","ਇ":"i","ਈ":"ī","ਉ":"u","ਊ":"ū","ਏ":"e","ਐ":"ai","ਓ":"o","ਔ":"au","ਕ":"ka","ਖ":"kha","ਗ":"ga","ਘ":"gha","ਙ":"ṅa","ਚ":"ca","ਛ":"cha","ਜ":"ja","ਝ":"jha","ਞ":"ña","ਟ":"ṭa","ਠ":"ṭha","ਡ":"ḍa","ਢ":"ḍha","ਣ":"ṇa","ਤ":"ta","ਥ":"tha","ਦ":"da","ਧ":"dha","ਨ":"na","ਪ":"pa","ਫ":"pha","ਬ":"ba","ਭ":"bha","ਮ":"ma","ਯ":"ya","ਰ":"ra","ਲ":"la","ਲ਼":"ḷa","ਵ":"va","ੜ":"ṛa","ਸ":"sa","ਹ":"ha","ਂ":"ṃ","ੰ":"ṁ","ਃ":"ḥ","\\u0A01":"m̐","ਾ":"ā","ਿ":"i","ੀ":"ī","ੁ":"u","ੂ":"ū","ੇ":"e","ੈ":"ai","ੋ":"o","ੌ":"au","ੱ":"","ੱਅ":":a","ੱਆ":":ā","ੱਇ":":i","ੱਈ":":ī","ੱਉ":":u","ੱਊ":":ū","ੱਏ":":e","ੱਐ":":ai","ੱਓ":":o","ੱਔ":":au","ੱਾ":":ā","ੱਿ":":i","ੱੀ":":ī","ੱੁ":":u","ੱੂ":":ū","ੱੇ":":e","ੱੈ":":ai","ੱੋ":":o","ੱੌ":":au","ਂਈ":"ī:ṃ","ੰਈ":"ī:ṁ","੦":"0","੧":"1","੨":"2","੩":"3","੪":"4","੫":"5","੬":"6","੭":"7","੮":"8","੯":"9","ਖ਼":"ḵẖa","ਕ਼":"qa","ਗ਼":"ġa","ਫ਼":"fa","ਸ਼":"śa","ਜ਼":"za"}}}}
