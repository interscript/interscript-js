One solution would be to use\n/ee/ to stand for the long /i/, as is often done (Sameer). The IC Standard will not\ndistinguish between these.\n","No distinction is made between: retroflex and non-retroflex consonants; and\nnasalized vowels and vowels followed by /n/.\n","A distinction is drawn between Urdu letters qaf and kaf (and correspondingly,\nHindi qa and ka).\n","A distinction is drawn between aspirated (e.g., /d/) and nonaspirated consonants\n(e.g., /dh/), with the exception of ch/chh, both represented by /ch/.\n","Digraphs: No distinction is made between digraphs such as /sh/ and single\ncontiguous letters such as /s/ followed by /h/.\n","Hyphens: Hyphens (-) are NOT used to connect name elements within a name:\nAbdur Rahman. The single exception to this is the izafat (i.e., linking vowel in\nnoun-link-modifier construction of Persian origin), which does show a hypen\nbefore the /e/ and a following space: Koh-e Nur (‘mountain of light’), “Jaish-e\nxx” (‘Army of xx’ construction).\n","Names incorporating “din” are written as one unit: Azermuddin, Badruddin,\nFaizuddin, Salahuddin.\n","Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name show the Arabic grammatical\nmarker /u/ rather than the /a/ of Allah: Abdullah (not Abdallah).\n","Inherent short vowel /a/ in Devanagari is represented with an /a/ in Roman. Final\nconsonants are assumed not to have a short /a/ (e.g., masc. name Ram Lal, not\nRama Lala).\n","As a general rule, Devanagari va is transcribed as a /v/: Vijay, Vishal, etc.\nException: /sw/ combination: Saraswati, Krishnaswami. Urdu wau, however, is\ntranscribed as /w/: Wasim, Walid.\n"],"tests":[{"source":"दिल्ली","expected":"dilli"},{"source":"भारत","expected":"bhart"},{"source":"विजय","expected":"vijy"},{"source":"विशाल","expected":"vishal"},{"source":"अब्दुल्ला","expected":"abdulla"},{"source":"संख्या","expected":"snkhya"},{"source":"संख्या","expected":"snkhya"},{"source":"समीर","expected":"smir"},{"source":"सरस्वती","expected":"srsvti"},{"source":"कृष्णास्वामी","expected":"krishnasvami"}],"map":{"characters":{"अ":"a","आ":"a","इ":"i","ई":"i","उ":"u","ऊ":"u","ऋ":"ri","ऌ":"l̤","ए":"e","ऐ":"ai","ओ":"o","ऑ":"au","औ":"au","ा":"a","ि":"i","ी":"i","ु":"u","ू":"u","ृ":"ri","े":"e","ै":"ai","ॅ":"ai","ो":"o","ौ":"au","ॉ":"au","क":"k","क्ष":"ksha","क़":"q","ख":"kh","ख़":"kh","ग":"g","ग़":"gh","घ":"gh","ङ":"n","च":"ch","छ":"ch","ज":"j","ज़":"z","झ":"jh","ञ":"n","ट":"t","ठ":"th","ड":"d","ड़":"r","ढ़":"rh","ढ":"dh","ण":"n","त":"t","थ":"th","द":"d","ध":"dh","न":"n","प":"p","फ़":"f","फ":"ph","ब":"b","भ":"bh","म":"m","य":"y","र":"r","ल":"l","व":"v","श":"sh","ष":"sh","स":"s","ह":"h","ं":"n","ँ":"n","्":"","ः":"h","़":""}}}}
