It is\nnot intended to eliminate variations of a name that can\ncontribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from\nmodern standard Arabic that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of\nthe name. Ambiguities can result from the Romanization of\nArabic names because the Arabic source generally omits\nshort vowel markings, double consonant marks, and other\ndiacritics that would clearly distinguish the name.\nLinguists use their experience with the language and aids\nsuch as on-line tools and name dictionaries to determine\nthe exact Arabic and the appropriate transliteration into\nthe Roman alphabet. In cases where an individual's name has\nalready been transliterated, that is to be indicated -- as\nfound -- in parentheses immediately following its rendition\nin the transliteration standard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (\nMohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original Arabic-\nscript spelling is known, that spelling should also appear\nin parentheses following the name, if possible, following\nbest practices of the issuing organization and taking into\nconsideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic\ninformation is not lost. For names of persons who are known\nto not be part of the Arabic-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that\nlanguage (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may\nbe used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell\nnames of individuals from languages that are written in\nRoman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou). In the\ncase of active senior government officials in the on-line\nCIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of\nState and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the\nspellings given in these on-line reference works should be\nused in place of the IC Standard. For any individual who\nhas at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those\nresources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, with the spelling,\nif known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage. The primary\ngoal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized\ntranscription of the name that is readable to the non-\nspecialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard (\nEnglish) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some\nambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the\nuse of diacritics. However, within the context of a report,\nwhere additional information about the individual is\nprovided, the referent will be clearly identified. This\nsystem will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name\ndictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings\nof names of well-known individuals.\n","notes":"- Long/Short Vowels: Long and short vowels are not\ndistinguished in this system Samir (could be Saamir or\nSamiir in Arabic).\n\n- Double consonants: Double consonants represented by the\nArabic shaddah are shown in most cases (e.g., Hassan,\nMuhammad). Exceptions: ’ayn and consonants represented by\ndigraphs are not doubled (e.g., al-Qadhafi [not\nalQadhdhafi], Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).\n\n- Hamzah (glottal stop): The hamzah is represented by an\napostrophe (’). Note that this is the same symbol used to\nrepresent another consonant, the ’ayn.\n\n- Ta’ marbutah (feminine ending marker): On the construct\nform or when pronounced “t”, it is represented with a roman\nt. In all other cases, it is represented with an h.\n\n- Digraphs: No distinction is made between digraphs such as\nsh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).\n\n- Definite article “al” (‘the’): Follows Arabic spelling\nrather than pronunciation. That is, sun letter assimilation\nis not shown in the Romanized form (e.g., ’Abd-alRahman,\nnot ’Abd-ar-Rahman).\n\n- Diphthongs: the second element of the diphthong is\n  represented by a y or a w (rather than an i or a u):\n  Haytham, Faysal, Tawfiq, Rawdah.\n\n- Hyphens: Hyphens (-) are used to connect name elements\n  within a name: ’Abd- al Rahman, Abu-al-Bashar, Bin-Ladin.\n  Exceptions: Names that incorporate “Allah” as part of the\n  name (e.g., ’Abdallah, Nasrallah), names marked by the\n  lineage/family marker “Al” (e.g., Al Thani) are not\n  hyphenated.\n\n- The definite article, “al”, within name phrases, is\n  Romanized as al and not as ul: Nur-al-Din (not Nur-ul-Din).\n  It is not capitalized when name-initial.\n\n- Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name retain the\n  a of Allah rather than a grammatical marker u: ’Abdallah (\n  not ’Abdullah).\n\n- Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Arabic are spelled\n  according to the standard Western tradition: Georges,\n  Michel. However, names of non-Arabic origin no longer\n  considered foreign by Arabic speakers follow the IC\n  conventions: Butrus (not Peter).\n\n- Prefix ‫بن‬ (bin ‘son of’) is Romanized Bin unless written\n  with an alif, in which case it is Romanized as Ibn. The\n  colloquial form Bu (‘father’) should not be standardized as\n  Abu. These prefixes are capitalized.\n\n- In general, Romanization follows the Modern Standard\n  Arabic (MSA) form rather than local pronunciation\n  standards. For example, the letter ‫ج‬ (jim) is represented\n  as a j even when pronounced as a “g” (e.g., Egyptian Gamal\n  is Romanized as Jamal).\n","tests":[{"source":"مِصر","expected":"Misr"},{"source":"قَطَر","expected":"Qatar"},{"source":"المَغرِب","expected":"Al Maghrib"},{"source":"الجُمهُورِيَّة العِراقِيَّة","expected":"Al Jumhuriyah al ’Iraqiyah"},{"source":"جُمهُورِيَّة العِراق","expected":"Jumhuriyat al ’Iraq"},{"source":"جُمهُورِيَّة مِصر العَرَبِيَّة","expected":"Jumhuriyat Misr al ’Arabiyah"},{"source":"بَغداد","expected":"Baghdad"},{"source":"تُونِس","expected":"Tunis"},{"source":"حَسّان","expected":"Hassan"},{"source":"مُحَمَّد","expected":"Muhammad"},{"source":"القَذَّافِي","expected":"Al Qadhafi"},{"source":"مُبَشِّر","expected":"Mubashir"},{"source":"الجَزائِر","expected":"Al Jaza’ir"},{"source":"عَبدالرَحمَن","expected":"’Abd-al-Rahman"},{"source":"هَيْثَم","expected":"Haytham"},{"source":"فَيْصَل","expected":"Faysal"},{"source":"تَوْفِيق","expected":"Tawfiq"},{"source":"رَوْضَة","expected":"Rawdah"},{"source":"نُورُالدِين","expected":"Nur-al-Din"},{"source":"عَبدُاللَّه","expected":"’Abdallah"}],"map":{"postrules":[{"pattern":"(?<=\\b)(?<!\\b[‘|’|'])[\\u0061-\\uFFFF]","result":"upcase"},{"pattern":" Al ","result":" al "},{"pattern":"-Al-","result":"-al-"}],"characters":{"\\u064e":"a","\\u064e(?=\\u0629)":"","\\u064e(?=a[h|t])":"","\\u0650":"i","\\u064f":"u","\\u0652":"","\\u0650\\u064a":"i","\\u0650\\u064a\\u0651\\u064e":"iy","\\u0650\\u064a(?=\\u064e|u064f)":"iy","\\u064f\\u0648":"u","\\u064e\\u0627":"a","\\u064e\\u0649":"á","\\u064e\\u0648\\u0652":"aw","\\u064e\\u064a\\u0652":"ay","\\u0622":"a","\\u0629":"at","\\u0629$":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{2})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{3})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{4})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{5})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{6})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{7})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{8})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{9})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{10})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{11})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{12})\\u0629":"ah","(?<=\\b\\u0627\\u0644[\\u0600-\\u06ff]{13})\\u0629":"ah","\\u0628\\u0651":"bb","\\u062a\\u0651":"tt","\\u062b\\u0651":"th","\\u062c\\u0651":"jj","\\u062d\\u0651":"hh","\\u062e\\u0651":"kh","\\u062f\\u0651":"dd","\\u0630\\u0651":"dh","\\u0631\\u0651":"rr","\\u0632\\u0651":"zz","\\u0633\\u0651":"ss","\\u0634\\u0651":"sh","\\u0635\\u0651":"ss","\\u0636\\u0651":"dd","\\u0637\\u0651":"tt","\\u0638\\u0651":"zz","\\u063a\\u0651":"gh","\\u0641\\u0651":"ff","\\u0642\\u0651":"qq","\\u0643\\u0651":"kk","\\u0644\\u0651":"ll","\\u0645\\u0651":"mm","\\u0646\\u0651":"nn","\\u0647\\u0651":"hh","\\u0648\\u0651":"ww","\\u064a\\u0651":"yy","\\u0626":"’","\\b\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u0651\\u064e\\u0647":"Allah","\\B\\u064f?\\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u0651\\u064e\\u0647":"allah","\\u0621":["’",""],"\\b\\u0627\\u0644":"al ","\\B\\u064f?\\u0627\\u0644":"-al-","\\u0623":"","\\b\\u0627":"","\\u0627":"a","\\u0628":"b","\\uFE91":"b","\\uFE92":"b","\\uFE90":"b","\\u062a":"t","\\ufe97":"t","\\ufe98":"t","\\ufe96":"t","\\u062b":"th","\\ufe9b":"th","\\ufe9c":"th","\\ufe9a":"th","\\u062c":"j","\\ufe9f":"j","\\ufea0":"j","\\ufe9e":"j","\\u062d":"h","\\ufea3":"h","\\ufea4":"h","\\ufea2":"h","\\u062e":"kh","\\ufea7":"kh","\\ufea8":"kh","\\ufea6":"kh","\\u062f":"d","\\ufeaa":"d","\\u0630":"dh","\\ufeac":"dh","\\u0631":"r","\\ufeae":"r","\\u0632":"z","\\ufeb0":"z","\\u0633":"s","\\ufeb3":"s","\\ufeb4":"s","\\ufeb2":"s","\\u0634":"sh","\\ufeb7":"sh","\\ufeb8":"sh","\\ufeb6":"sh","\\u0635":"s","\\ufebb":"s","\\ufebc":"s","\\ufeba":"s","\\u0636":"d","\\ufebf":"d","\\ufec0":"d","\\ufebe":"d","\\u0637":"t","\\ufec3":"t","\\ufec4":"t","\\ufec2":"t","\\u0638":"z","\\ufec7":"z","\\ufec8":"z","\\ufec6":"z","\\u0639":"’","\\ufecb":"’","\\ufecc":"’","\\ufeca":"’","\\u063a":"gh","\\ufecf":"gh","\\ufed0":"gh","\\ufece":"gh","\\u0641":"f","\\ufed3":"f","\\ufed4":"f","\\ufed2":"f","\\u0642":"q","\\ufed7":"q","\\ufed8":"q","\\ufed6":"q","\\u0643":"k","\\ufedb":"k","\\ufedc":"k","\\ufeda":"k","\\u0644":"l","\\ufedf":"l","\\ufee0":"l","\\ufede":"l","\\u0645":"m","\\ufee3":"m","\\ufee4":"m","\\ufee2":"m","\\u0646":"n","\\ufee7":"n","\\ufee8":"n","\\ufee6":"n","\\u0647":"h","\\ufeeb":"h","\\ufeec":"h","\\ufeea":"h","\\u0648":"w","\\ufeee":"w","\\u064a":"y","\\ufef3":"y","\\ufef4":"y","\\ufef1":"y"}}}}
